        <h3>A Pinots.Games server comes with amazing features.</h3>
        <p>Since the dawn of <a target="_blank" href="https://sailsjs.com/about">renting $5 minecraft servers</a> to play with friends, we've found ourselves looking for some of the same key features over and over again between servers.  So we picked some of the things that kept popping up, implemented our own opinionated solutions for them, and then included it all in every one of our server implementations!</p>

        <img alt="computer with email symbol on screen" src="/images/setup-email.png"/>
        </div>
        <h5>Set up your branding and content</h5>
        <p>This starter app includes several different page templates (including the one you're reading right now) that you can change as much or as little as you like.  If there are any pages you won't need, just remove them.</p>
        <p>To get started, do a global find/replace in this project for occurrences of <code>Pinots Games</code> and replace them all with the actual name of your app or platform ("Facebag").  Then do the same thing again to replace <code>Socialites</code> with the actual name of your organization ("Facebag Corporation").</p>
        <blockquote><small>This app also includes a default <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.  We want to make it easier for apps to be transparent about their users' rights and privacy.  But we are developers, not lawyers; and this is <em>definitely not legal advice</em>.  Before going live, be sure to replace these example documents with your own company's policies, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counsel" target="_blank">seek counsel</a> for assistance if you need to design new terms from scratch.</small></blockquote>

        <div class="step-image">
        <img alt="computer with credit card icon on screen" src="/images/setup-payment.png"/>
        </div>
        <h5>Configure integrations</h5>
        <p>In order for this app to send automated emails, you'll need to create a <a target="_blank" href="https://mailgun.com">Mailgun</a> account.  Then, in <code>config/custom.js</code>, configure the following:</p>
        <div class="card bg-light mb-4">
          <div class="card-body"><pre><code><span class="text-muted">// Recipient of contact form messages</span>
internalEmailAddress: my.email@example.com,

<span class="text-muted">// For outgoing emails</span>
fromEmailAddress: 'noreply@example.com',
fromName: 'The Pinots Games Team',

<span class="text-muted">// Mailgun settings</span>
mailgunDomain: 'transactional-mail.example.com',
mailgunSecret: 'key-testkeyb183848139913858e8abd9a3'</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>To enable support for billing features, you'll need to make a <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> account, then include your test credentials like so:</p>
        <div class="card bg-light mb-4">
          <div class="card-body"><pre><code><span class="text-muted">// Stripe credentials</span>
stripePublishableKey: 'pk_test_Zzd814nldl91104qor5911gjald',
stripeSecret: 'sk_test_Zzd814nldl91104qor5911gjald'</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <blockquote><small>If your app doesn't need payment processing, it will still work without Stripe configuration. In this case, all references to billing will just be omitted from the UI.</small></blockquote>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-image">
        <img alt="computer with sails logo on screen" src="/images/setup-customize.png"/>
        </div>
        <h5>Customize</h5>
        <p>Once the initial configuration is done, you're ready to start building out the rest of your app.</p>
        <p>We worked hard to make this starter app's structure consistent and its files are as bare-bones as possible, so it's easy to add new pages and business logic following the conventions we set up. If you run into trouble, have a look at <a href="/faq">your new FAQ page</a>, which covers the tools we used and how to customize.  For a deeper dive, check out the Sails <a href="https://courses.platzi.com/courses/sails-js/">walkthrough</a>, <a href="https://sailsjs.com/documentation">reference documentation</a> and <a href="https://sailsjs.com/support">support</a> pages.</p>

      <h3>It's Game Time</h3>
      <p>We think this is a pretty convenient starting point, but of course there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The good news is, we have highly trained staff, so you can jump into the server and adapt it to your needs. Change some settings around. Break stuff. Have us fix it. And above all: <strong>make something fun</strong>.</p>
